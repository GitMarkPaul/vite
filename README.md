## About Vite

Vite is a build tool for modern web development that provides a fast and flexible development server and a highly optimized build pipeline. It was developed by Evan You, the creator of the Vue.js framework, but it can be used with any JavaScript framework or library.

## Key Features

- Fast development server: Vite uses native ES modules to serve your code, which enables instant server-startup times and faster hot module replacement.
- Flexible build pipeline: Vite leverages Rollup to provide a highly optimized build pipeline that produces fast and small production builds.
- Plugin-based architecture: Vite's functionality can be extended using plugins, which allows for easy customization and integration with other tools.
- Modern web development support: Vite has built-in support for modern web development features like ES modules, TypeScript, JSX, CSS modules, and more.
